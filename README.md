# Next-Gen Oral Cancer Detection 🦷✨

### AI-Assisted Diagnosis using ConvNeXt & PyTorch

Welcome to **Next-Gen Oral Cancer Detection**, a deep learning project designed to assist in the early screening of oral lesions. This tool leverages **ConvNeXt**, a state-of-the-art Convolutional Neural Network, to classify images as either **Cancerous** or **Non-Cancerous** with high precision.

Our goal is to provide a fast, non-invasive "second opinion" tool that bridges the gap between advanced AI research and practical medical application.

## 📌 Key Features

* **🧠 Advanced Architecture:** Built on a fine-tuned **ConvNeXt Base** model (PyTorch), chosen for its superior performance over traditional CNNs like ResNet.
* **🎯 High Accuracy:** The model achieved a **95.8% F1-Score** on unseen test data, minimizing dangerous false negatives.
* **🔍 Explainable AI:** Integrated **Grad-CAM** technology allows us to "see" what the model sees, generating heatmaps that highlight suspicious regions for clinician review.
* **💻 User-Friendly Interface:** Features a clean HTML/CSS frontend with drag-and-drop upload, powered by a robust **Flask** Python backend.
